# BluVEngine

### Introduction
BluVEngine is a personal small framework for working with the SFML Library. Currently It's being worked on privatly to be a fully usable Game Engine.

### How to Build
Requirements:
- SFML 2.5
- CMake
- Make Build Tools (Linux)
- MingW64 Build Tools (Windows)

Clone the git repo, open the terminal then type:
```BASH
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
# use mingw64-make command on Windows instead of make
make 
```
